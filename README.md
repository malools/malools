### Hi ! Here are some repositories and projects I contributed to during my studies and free time !

### Personal project : 
[Analyzing traffic road accidents in France in 2022](https://github.com/malools/french-road-accidents)

### Machine Learning : 
- [Machine Learning project (Road segmentation)](https://github.com/CS-433/ml-project-2-mnf) : Implemented and trained all the models (using Kaggle GPUs) and wrote report.
### Applied Data Analysis : 
- [Data Analysis project](https://github.com/epfl-ada/ada-2023-project-datacuisiniers) : Worked on the 'longevity score' part and overall comparison plots.
- [Data Analysis Homework 1](https://github.com/epfl-ada/ada-2023-homework-1-datacuisiniers) : Contributed to code.
- [Data Analysis Homework 2](https://github.com/epfl-ada/ada-2023-homework-2-datacuisiniers) : Contributed to code.
### Distributed Information Systems : 
- [Distributed Information Systems project 1 (Information Retrieval)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pascalnguyenepfl/dis-project-1): Developed the top-k re-ranking part.
- [Distributed Information Systems project 2 (Recommender Systems)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pascalnguyenepfl/dis-project-2): Prepared the dataset and implemented Matrix Factorization part.
- [Distributed Information Systems project 3 (Named Entity Disambiguation)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pascalnguyenepfl/dis-project-3): Implemented the BERT model for better precision.
### Image Processing for Earth Observation : 
- [Computer Vision project (Glacier monitoring)](https://github.com/Eddyvmgit/ipeo_glacier) : Implemented and trained some of the models, worked on plots.
